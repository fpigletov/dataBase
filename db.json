                    "1": "There are some common furniture buying mistakes that people make, which often leads to buyer remorse. Here are the 10 most important things to focus on when consulting your customers about what to avoid when buying furniture for their new home, along with some suggestions.",
                    "2": "NOT MEASURIN: Measuring your space before you buy any new furniture is absolutely crucial. If you do not measure, your furniture might not fit through the door, or it will not fit properly in the room. Record the dimensions of every room of the home, noting the length and width in feet. You should also draw a basic layout on paper to help you choose the right size furniture for every space. A sectional will not fit correctly if you have a small living room, for example. Measuring furniture includes checking the length, width, depth, and height of every piece. This will ensure that every item you buy fits nicely in its designated spot.",
                    "3": "NOT SCALING: Proper scale and proportion are key to a functional space. Make sure your new furniture works well in the room and does not overcrowd it. If the furniture is too large in proportion to the size of the room, everything will feel cramped. If it is too small, the room will feel hollow and empty. Choose everything in tandem so that every item works well with the other to create a correctly scaled space. ",
                    "4": "NOT CONSIDERING YOUR LIFESTYLE: If you have children or pets, you need to select furniture that fits your lifestyle. Choose upholstered pieces that are easy to clean and maintain if you have a lot of foot traffic and a large family. Having beautiful furniture in your new home is important, but it won’t do any good if it isn’t functional too. Look at each item and think about how it will fit your lifestyle before you purchase.",
                    "5": "BEING UNREALISTIC ABOUT MAINTENANCE: All furniture undergoes regular wear and tear, but some materials are easier to maintain than others. Always make sure that your new furniture can be cleaned easily and that it’s not too difficult to repair if something ever gets broken. Search for furniture that’s easy to care for, so you’re not spending all of your time worrying about maintaining it or keeping it clean. Stock up on products to help you maintain it, like wood furniture polishes and waxes, leather conditioners, and a quality vacuum cleaner to get rid of crumbs between sofa cushions.",
                    "6": "BUYING EVERYTHING AT ONCE: Buying furniture is exciting, so it’s easy to feel like you need to buy everything at once. Furnishing an entire room or even your entire home all at one time could lead to buyer’s remorse later. Focus on the most important pieces first, like the bed for your bedroom, the dining table for your dining room, and the sofa for your living room. You can always add new items to go with it later once you determine which styles, sizes, and designs will work best in each room and for your specific lifestyle.",
                    "7": "GETTING INTO “IMPULSE BUY”: Don’t get lured into furniture trends and make an impulse purchase that you’ll regret later. Take your time and research furniture, looking carefully at things like customer reviews and examples of furniture in different homes. When you take your time buying furniture, you’ll be much happier with the outcome.",
                    "8": "PRIORITIZING STYLE OVER COMFORT: A beautiful home filled with stylish furniture is important, but your comfort is more important. Don’t sacrifice your comfort just to give your home a stylish look. If your new furniture is uncomfortable, you’ve essentially wasted your hard-earned money. Try to find pieces that meet somewhere in the middle, blending beautiful design with supportive and comfortable features.",
                    "9": "SACRIFICING QUALITY FOR PRICE: Saving money on furniture is always a good thing, but you shouldn’t skimp on quality. Look for great deals on furniture that will still provide you with a quality piece you’ll use for years to come. Remember that new furniture at an extremely low price usually means that it’s made of low-quality materials, and it might not hold up to a lot of wear and tear.",
                    "10": "OVERFILLING THE ROOM: If you buy too many furniture pieces, it can make the rooms in your home feel cramped and overcrowded. Adding too much furniture will end up making your home feel cluttered, which can lead to higher stress levels. Try to stick with the basics first, then add accent pieces as needed."

                    "1": "SHOP ONLINE: Shopping online is one of the easiest, most effective ways to save money on everything from furniture to décor and more. Look for websites that offer free shipping to save even more. Before you click the “purchase” button, make sure you read the customer reviews thoroughly to ensure that you’re getting a good deal and a quality item.",
                    "2": "GARAGE SALE: Scour local garage sales to find decent quality furniture. In many cases, homeowners simply need to downsize, or they don’t want to take perfectly good furniture with them for a move. You can always negotiate with the seller to bring the price down even lower, too.",
                    "3": "BUING ANTIQUE FURNITURE: Not all antique furniture costs an arm and a leg. Shop at some local consignment stores to score a good deal on beautiful antiques. The perk of buying antique furniture is that it’s typically made of durable materials, and it’s built to last, so you’re getting more out of your investment.",
                    "4": "REPURPOSE AND RECYCLE: You don’t have to buy every single thing brand-new for your home. In fact, some of your furniture can easily be repurposed or recycled. An older coffee table can look new again with a fresh coat of chalk paint. Go through the items you already own to see how many of them can be repurposed or reused in other rooms or for different reasons.",
                    "5": "REFURBISH: Refurbished furniture can look just as beautiful and last just as long as new furniture. Switch out hardware, add a fresh coat of paint or finish, or reinforce furniture to make it stronger. Simple changes to existing furniture can make it look brand-new and give it a new purpose without breaking your budget.",
                    "6": "UPCYCLE: Upcycling furniture is similar to refurbishing, and it involves adding your own personal touch to each piece. You can make any piece of furniture look brand-new with some simple changes like painting it, adding new hardware, or taking it apart and rebuilding it to turn it into something new.",
                    "7": "DIY: If you’re handy with a hammer and nails, don’t be afraid to try your hand at some DIY furniture. Building your own furniture creates feelings of pride and a sense of satisfaction. It’s also an excellent way to save money on new items like tables or chairs."

The Celine oval bench in channel tufting, with its capsule shaped curve and faux shearling, brings aesthetic and function in one piece.

Situated on the island's southwestern tip, the hypnotising magnificence of Le Morne Brabant is more than deserving of its UNESCO listed status. Just a brief boat ride from the mainland, the islet of Ile Aux Aigrettes is one of many isles and boat excursion tour options to consider. What makes this a must-visit place for wildlife enthusiasts in Mauritius is the focus on scientific research within the nature reserve."

Of course, the main draws when travelling to Dominica is nature itself. Hiking, water sports, and enjoying the slower pace of life form the basis of the perfect Dominica trip, but there are also other ways to keep your self entertained."

But the truth is, I barely did Mallorca justice because I went with that expectation myself. I was looking forward to a holiday, think crystal-clear waters, days by the beach, afternoons snacking on tapas and relaxing in the lush 5-star hotel in Mallorca I’d booked into. I even left my camera at home so I could completely switch off, with just a few changes of clothes and my iPhone in my pocket. What I found in Mallorca though was so much more than I had been expecting. If you are a Brit like me, then the reputation of Magaluf is something you will be well aware of; but in reality, Magaluf is such a tiny part of this island there is a whole host of history, culture and amazing nature to enjoy."
